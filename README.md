## Mona Lisa Game of Life
Finding Game of Life states that eventually turn into pictures.

\<Insert demonstration gif here>

#### TO-DO
1. Develop animation stuff: pass a life; save sketch?; set frame rate; play for a certain number of frames.
2. Convert GoL to SAT equation, pass to SAT solver. Gardens of Eden seem rare / weird-looking enough that it should be possible. The resulting SAT might be too big for SAT, or might not. Probably not.
3. Write a function that does it N times.
4. Run it on smiley face / Mona Lisa / whatever, save result.
5. Write it up.
